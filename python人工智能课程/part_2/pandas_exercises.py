# Create a Pandas DataFrame that contains the ratings some users have given to a

# Users that have np.nan values means that the user has not yet rated that book.
# Use the data above to create a Pandas DataFrame that has the following column
# labels: 'Author', 'Book Title', 'User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3', 'User 4'. Let Pandas
# automatically assign numerical row indices to the DataFrame.

# Create a dictionary with the data given above
dat = {"Book Title": books,

       "user_1": user_1,
       "user_2": user_2,

# Use the dictionary to create a Pandas DataFrame
book_ratings = pd.DataFrame(dat)

# If you created the dictionary correctly you should have a Pandas DataFrame
# that has column labels: 'Author', 'Book Title', 'User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3',
# 'User 4' and row indices 0 through 4.

# Now replace all the NaN values in your DataFrame with the average rating in
# each column. Replace the NaN values in place. HINT: you can use the fillna()
# function with the keyword inplace = True, to do this. Write your code below:
book_ratings.fillna(book_ratings.mean(), inplace=True)
print(book_ratings)

# 找出有评价为5分的电影名称
best_rates = book_ratings[(book_ratings == 5).any(axis=1)]['Book Title'].values
